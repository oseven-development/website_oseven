Rent-an-Admin – Your Dedicated Azure Administrator on Demand

Many small and medium-sized companies rely on Microsoft Azure — but few have the time, staff, or in-house expertise to manage it safely and efficiently.
With OSeven Rent-an-Admin, you get a certified Azure Administrator who takes care of your environment as if it were their own: secure, optimized, compliant, and always available.

Our administrators combine enterprise-level cloud expertise with the pragmatic mindset SMBs need — focused on reliability, cost efficiency, and clear communication.

What Our Azure Administrators Do for You

Comprehensive Operations and Resource Management

We take full responsibility for your Azure infrastructure — provisioning, configuring, and managing all workloads such as virtual machines, databases, and networks.
Every environment is structured using best-practice conventions: resource groups, tagging, naming standards, and policies that ensure transparency and traceability.
We maintain subscription hygiene, apply governance controls, and scale resources based on performance and cost insights.
The result: a stable, well-organized, and easily auditable Azure landscape.

⸻

Continuous Monitoring and Cost Optimization

Our admins continuously monitor the health and performance of your resources through Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Azure Advisor.
We proactively detect under-utilized or over-provisioned resources, right-size compute instances, and automate off-hours shutdowns for non-production workloads.
By leveraging Azure Cost Management + Billing, we establish budgets, allocate spending by tag, and identify savings opportunities such as Reserved Instances and Savings Plans.
The outcome is predictable billing and measurable ROI — with monthly reports showing exactly where your money goes.

⸻

Security, Compliance, and Governance

Security and compliance are at the heart of our service.
Our administrators implement strong Identity and Access Management through Azure Active Directory — enforcing multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, and conditional access policies.
We configure network security groups, firewalls, and Key Vaults to protect your data.
Compliance with ISO 27001, GDPR, and BSI frameworks is maintained via Azure Policy and Defender for Cloud continuous assessments.
Regular reviews ensure that every subscription remains compliant with corporate and legal requirements — so you can pass audits without surprises.

⸻

Backup and Disaster Recovery

Business continuity is non-negotiable.
We design and maintain robust backup and recovery solutions using Azure Backup and Site Recovery to safeguard VMs, databases, and storage accounts.
Regular restore testing, replication setup, and backup integrity checks guarantee your data is protected even in a worst-case scenario.
In the event of an outage, workloads fail over automatically — minimizing downtime and ensuring peace of mind.

⸻

Automation, Efficiency, and Scalability

Our administrators bring automation discipline to every environment.
They use Infrastructure-as-Code technologies such as Bicep, ARM templates, and Terraform to deploy and manage infrastructure reproducibly.
Routine operations — like patching, tagging, and reporting — are scripted through Azure CLI and PowerShell Az modules, reducing manual work and human error.
For dynamic workloads, we configure auto-scaling and serverless architectures, allowing your infrastructure to expand or contract seamlessly with demand.

Certified Expertise You Can Trust

Our Azure Administrators hold official Microsoft certifications:
	•	Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)
This certification validates deep expertise in configuring virtual networks, managing compute and storage, handling identities, and monitoring Azure environments.
It ensures that your administrator can deploy, optimize, and secure Azure workloads according to Microsoft’s own standards.
	•	Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)
A foundational credential covering cloud principles, Azure architecture, and cost models — ensuring every admin understands both the technical and business dimensions of Azure.
	•	Optional Specializations (as required)
	•	Azure Security Engineer (AZ-500) for advanced security management
	•	Azure Solutions Architect (AZ-305) for infrastructure design
	•	Microsoft 365 / Entra ID Integration for hybrid identity and collaboration scenarios

Each OSeven Administrator undergoes continuous Microsoft Learn and hands-on lab training, keeping skills aligned with the latest Azure features and best practices.

The Tools We Use

We operate your environment using the same toolset trusted by Microsoft’s own operations teams:
	•	Azure Portal for visual management and dashboards
	•	Azure CLI and PowerShell Az for automation and bulk operations
	•	Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Log Analytics for observability
	•	Azure Security Center / Defender for Cloud for real-time threat detection
	•	Azure Automation, DevOps Pipelines, and Terraform for deployment workflows
	•	Azure Backup, Site Recovery, and Storage Explorer for data protection

Together, these tools provide transparency, control, and operational consistency — without locking you out of your own cloud.

Tailored for SMB Reality

OSeven Rent-an-Admin is built for the practical needs of small and medium-sized businesses:
	•	Cost Efficiency: We design each environment to use only what you need — right-sized VMs, lifecycle rules for storage, and clear budget alerts.
	•	Scalability: Your infrastructure grows as your business grows — automatically, without over-provisioning.
	•	Security & Compliance: Enterprise-grade protection with GDPR alignment out of the box.
	•	Simplicity: Clear communication, human support, and documentation your team can actually understand.

Instead of maintaining an internal cloud team, you rent a senior administrator who brings both the technical depth and the accountability your business deserves.
